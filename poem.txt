Love-for-life and healing.

For tender grass, so fresh, so sweet;
For flowers that bloom about our feet;
For song of bird, and hum of bee;
For all things fair we hear or see,
Father in heaven, we thank Thee!
For a little rain-cloud in the skies;
A little joy in two sweet eyes;
For dear people, who help you get through the day,
When ways grow strange,and skies grow grey
When walls of doubt arise - then dear,
Look up, for God is always near.
Problems you dealing,
There are nothing, prey, is healing.
Come home, where thoughts find rest,
And Calm, comes to nest.
Come home, when something feels wrong
or you just need a place to belong.
God awaits,
Come home:Be healed
And your path will be revealed.
I wonder how,how it would be 
To be a bird, to be free.
