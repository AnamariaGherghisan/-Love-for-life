Love-for-life

For tender grass, so fresh, so sweet;
For flowers that bloom about our feet;
For song of bird, and hum of bee;
For all things fair we hear or see,
Father in heaven, we thank Thee!
For a little rain-cloud in the skies;
A little joy in two sweet eyes;
For dear people, who help you get through the day,
When ways grow strange,and skies grow grey
When walls of doubt arise - then dear,
Look up, for God is always near.
